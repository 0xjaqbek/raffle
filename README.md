Raffle (Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm)

Raffle and Mint dApp connects to the smart contract on the Scroll. 

It utilizes the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to generate random numbers. 

After connecting your wallet, click "Draw" to get the results of tokens You get. 

You can mint without drawing, but it will execute with minting 0 tokens. 

As always in my dApp's, no costs involved besides used to run functions. 

No rewards for participating in raffle besides increased on-chain interactions.
